### Data Flow 1 – Risk Identification

The following risks have been identified for the user authentication and interaction flow:

- **Confidentiality risk:** exposure of user credentials or sensitive data during authentication. An example is:
                            A malicious user intercepts username and password used by a user.
- **Integrity risk:** manipulation of user inputs leading to unauthorized actions. An example is:
                            A malicious actor manipulates request parameters to escalate privileges and gain administrative access.
- **Availability risk:** denial of service impacting user access to the application. An example is:
                            A malicious user performs a DOS attack, trying to access the system multiple times.
- **Accountability risk:** insufficient logging of authentication and user interaction events. An example is:
                            Authentication and user interaction events are not adequately logged, limiting traceability.

### Data Flow 2 – Risk Identification

The following risks have been identified for the application requests flow:

- **Confidentiality risk:** exposure of sensitive data contained in application requests. An example is:
                            A malicious actor intercepts a request containing medical data transmitted to the backend.
- **Integrity risk:** manipulation of user requests leading to unauthorized actions. An example is:
                            A malicious actor manipulates a request, allowing unauthorized access to additional information.
- **Availability risk:** denial of service impacting user access to the application. An example is:
                            The backend is overwhelmed by a high volume of requests, leading to service unavailability during critical situations.
- **Accountability risk:** insufficient logging of application requests events. An example is:
                            Application request events are not adequately logged, limiting traceability of backend operations.

### Data Flow 3 – Risk Identification

The following risks have been identified for the clinical data storage flow:

- **Confidentiality risk:** exposure of sensitive clinical data during storage or access. An example is:
                            A malicious actor gains unauthorized access to stored clinical data.
- **Integrity risk:** unauthorized modification of stored clinical data. An example is:
                            A malicious actor alters stored clinical records.
- **Availability risk:** denial of service impacting user access to the application. An example is:
                            The clinical data storage is overwhelmed by a high volume of requests, leading to service unavailability during critical situations.
- **Accountability risk:** insufficient logging of data access events events. An example is:
                            Clinical data access and modification events are not adequately logged, limiting traceability.

### Data Flow 4 – Risk Identification

The following risks have been identified for the AI data processing flow:

- **Confidentiality risk:** exposure of sensitive data inferred from AI outputs. An example is:
                            A malicious actor intercepts AI-generated suggestions containing sensitive information.
- **Integrity risk:** manipulation of AI inference results leading to incorrect or unsafe outputs. An example is:
                            A malicious actor influences AI outputs, modifying the advice generated by the system.
- **Availability risk:** denial of service impacting AI inference availability. An example is:
                            The AI inference module is overwhelmed by a high volume of requests, leading to service unavailability during critical situations.
- **Accountability risk:** insufficient logging of AI interaction events. An example is:
                            AI inference and interaction events are not adequately logged, limiting traceability of backend operations.

### Data Flow 5 – Risk Identification

The following risks have been identified for the Logging and Monitoring flow:

- **Confidentiality risk:** exposure of logs or monitoring data containing sensitive information. An example is:
                            A malicious actor gains unauthorized access to backend logs containing user identifiers or system information.
- **Integrity risk:** tampering with logs or monitoring events to conceal malicious activities. An example is:
                            A malicious actor alters access logs to hinder the identification of a compromised user account.
- **Availability risk:** disruption of logging and monitoring services. An example is:
                            A malicious actor floods the monitoring system with events, preventing detection of real incidents.
- **Accountability risk:** lack of traceability of security-relevant events. An example is:
                            Security incidents cannot be attributed to specific users or components due to insufficient logging and monitoring.
