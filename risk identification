### Data Flow 1 – Risk Identification

The following risks have been identified for the user authentication and interaction flow:

- **Confidentiality risk:** exposure of user credentials or sensitive data during authentication. An example is:
                            A malicious user intercepts username and password used by a user.
- **Integrity risk:** manipulation of user inputs leading to unauthorized actions. An example is:
                            A malicious user changes the role of his account, becoming an admin of the system.
- **Availability risk:** denial of service impacting user access to the application. An example is:
                            A malicious user performs a DOS attack, trying to access the system multiple times.
- **Accountability risk:** insufficient logging of authentication and user interaction events. An example is:
                            Authentication and user interaction events are not adequately logged, limiting traceability.

### Data Flow 2 – Risk Identification

The following risks have been identified for the application requests flow:

- **Confidentiality risk:** exposure of user credentials or sensitive data during authentication. An example is:
                            A malicious user intercepts username and password used by a user.
- **Integrity risk:** manipulation of user inputs leading to unauthorized actions. An example is:
                            A malicious user changes the role of his account, becoming an admin of the system.
