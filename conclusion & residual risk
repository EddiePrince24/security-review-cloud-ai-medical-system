## Conclusion ##

The project described a security review perfomed on a web application that acted as a medical system with an AI component deployed in a cloud infrastructure.

The system architecture and data flows were defined and represented through graphical diagrams to support a structured security analysis.

Based on the architecture and data flows, a threat-driven risk identification was conducted. For each data flow, risks related to confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability
were identified, considering potential threat actors and attack scenarios.

After the risk identification, for each risk the likelihood and impact were estimated, providing a justification to present the reasoning. The values for likelihood and impact have the folloing values:
- Low associated with 1
- Medium associated with 2
- High associated with 3

After the risk evaluation, for each risk 3 security controls were associated belonging to three types (Preventive, Corrective, Deductive). The proposed controls aim to reduce the likelihood 
and/or impact of the identified risks and reflect common security engineering practices for web-based and AI-enabled medical systems.

This project demonstrates a structured approach to security risk assessment, bridging system architecture, threat analysis, and technical security controls, with particular
attention to regulated and safety-critical environments.

## Risk Evaluation ##

After the definition of the proposed security controls, a residual level of risk remains, as it is not feasible to completely eliminate all security threats in complex systems.

In this theoretical case study, residual risk was qualitatively assessed. The implemented security controls are expected to significantly reduce the likelihood and/or impact of the identified risks;
however, risks cannot be considered fully eliminated.

Residual risks may still arise due to factors such as:
- Advanced or previously unknown attack techniques
- Human errors or misconfigurations
- Exceptional operational conditions (e.g., peak usage or emergency scenarios)
- Limitations or unexpected behaviors of AI components

In a real-world deployment, residual risk should be continuously monitored and reassessed through operational security activities, such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, security
monitoring, and incident response, in alignment with standards such as ISO/IEC 27001.
