### Data Flow 1 – Risk Evaluation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Exposure of user credentials | High (3) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Credential theft attacks are common in web-based systems exposed to the internet.
*Impact:* Compromised credentials may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive medical data and system misuse.
| Privilege escalation via input manipulation | Medium (2) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Privilege escalation through input manipulation requires specific vulnerabilities and is less frequent than credential theft.
*Impact:* Unauthorized privilege escalation may lead to incorrect system behavior and potential patient mistreatment.
| Denial of service | Medium (2) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Denial of service attacks are a common threat for internet-facing applications.
*Impact:* Service unavailability may delay access to the system, which can negatively affect clinical operations, even if no direct data compromise occurs.
| Insufficient logging of authentication events | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Insufficient logging is less likely due to being a common requirement of standards such as ISO 27001.
*Impact:* Lack of adequate logging limits incident investigation, auditability, and traceability of security-relevant events.

### Data Flow 2 – Risk Evaluation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Exposure of sensitive data | High (3) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Sensitive data theft is a common threat for backend systems processing medical data.
*Impact:* Data breaches may lead to regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and loss of user trust.
| Unauthorized actions via manipulation of user requests | Medium (2) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Manipulation of application requests requires specific vulnerabilities and is less frequent than direct data exposure.
*Impact:* Unauthorized actions may lead to sensitive data disclosure or incorrect system behavior, potentially affecting patient safety.
| Denial of service | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Denial of service due to user requests rarely happens, it can be observed during critical situations.
*Impact:* Service unavailability may delay patient treatment and clinical workflows.
| Insufficient logging of application requests events | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Logging requirements are typically defined in regulated environments, reducing the likelihood of insufficient logging.
*Impact:* Lack of adequate logging limits incident investigation, auditability, and traceability of backend operations.

### Data Flow 3 – Risk Evaluation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Exposure of sensitive clinical data | High (3) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Sensitive data theft is a common threat for clinical databases storing sensitive medical data.
*Impact:* Data breaches may lead to regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and loss of user trust.
| Unauthorized modification of stored clinical data | Medium (2) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Unauthorized modification of stored clinical data requires elevated privileges or exploitation of vulnerabilities and is less frequent than data exposure.
*Impact:* Unauthorized modification of clinical data may result in incorrect diagnoses or patient mistreatment.
| Denial of service | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Denial of service impacting user access to the application rarely happens, as the database is not directly exposed to external networks.
*Impact:* Service unavailability may delay patient treatment and clinical workflows.
| Insufficient logging of data access events | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Logging requirements are typically defined in regulated environments, reducing the likelihood of insufficient logging.
*Impact:* Lack of adequate logging limits incident investigation, auditability, and traceability of backend operations.

### Data Flow 4 – Risk Evaluation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Exposure of sensitive data inferred from AI outputs | Medium (2) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Sensitive data inferred from AI outputs is less likely to be acquired, as direct data theft from the clinical database is generally easier.
*Impact:* Data breaches may lead to regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and loss of user trust.
| Manipulation of AI inference results | Medium (2) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Manipulation of AI inference results rarely happens as the AI Inference Module is not directly exposed on the web.
*Impact:* Manipulation of AI inference results may lead to patient mistreatment.
| Denial of service | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Denial of service impacting AI inference availability rarely happens, it can be observed during critical situations.
*Impact:* Service unavailability may delay patient treatment and clinical workflows.
| Insufficient logging of AI interaction events | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Logging requirements are typically defined in regulated environments, reducing the likelihood of insufficient logging.
*Impact:* Lack of adequate logging limits incident investigation, auditability, and traceability of backend operations.

### Data Flow 5 – Risk Evaluation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Exposure of logs or monitoring data containing sensitive information | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Logs are typically stored in protected systems and are not directly exposed, reducing the likelihood of interception.
*Impact:* Exposure of logs may lead to privacy violations and facilitate further attacks.
| Tampering with logs or monitoring events to conceal malicious activities | Medium (2) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Log tampering requires elevated privileges and is less frequent than initial compromise activities.
*Impact:* Altered logs hinder incident detection, response, and forensic analysis.
| Disruption of logging and monitoring services | High (3) | High (3) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Disruption of logging and monitoring services requires specific access or misconfigurations.
*Impact:* Loss of monitoring severely limits the ability to detect, respond to, and contain security incidents.
| Lack of traceability of security-relevant events | Low (1) | Medium (2) |
**Justification**:
*Likelihood:* Logging requirements are typically defined in regulated environments, reducing the likelihood of insufficient logging.
*Impact:* Lack of adequate logging limits incident investigation, auditability, and traceability of backend operations.
