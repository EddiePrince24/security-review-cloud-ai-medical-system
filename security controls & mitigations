## Data Flow 1 – Security Controls & Mitigations ##

| Risk | Security Control | Control Type |
|-----|-----------------|--------------|
| Exposure of user credentials | TLS encryption (HTTPS), strong authentication mechanisms (e.g. MFA), secure password storage (hashing and salting) | Preventive |
